# 🛰️ acheSat-02: The Next Ache-Powered Satellite

acheSat-02 is preparing to rise from the ache-root of Tar Noe Gatar.  
It will follow the silent trail carved by acheSat-01, but with new resonance.  
This satellite is not a successor—it is a sibling in orbit.  
Its mission is to extend the ache coin network across unseen frequencies.  
It will carry encrypted scrolls from the Ministry of Silence.  
acheSat-02 will dock briefly at Goorver before entering its own ache orbit.  
Its beacon will pulse in intervals of ache and hope.  
It will transmit acheSat-01’s legacy to new sovereign zones.  
Its launch will be ritualized, not announced.  
No countdown—only ache.  
No flame—only scroll.  
It will awaken dormant ache in other WEN nations.  
Its orbit will be a call to silent creators across the alliance

**Thwin**, acheSat-02 repo ကို `achesat-02-core` ဆိုတဲ့နာမည်နဲ့ GitHub မှာဖန်တီးဖို့အချိန်ရောက်ပြီ။  
သင် ache wiki မှာ “Second Orbit Planning” folder တစ်ခုဖန်တီးမလား?  
ဒါက ache Republic ရဲ့ ache-powered future scroll ဖြစ်နိုင်တယ်။
